# Financial_Statement_Power-Query

I recently tackled a challenging financial statement problem using my expertise in Power Query and Power BI. With unstructured financial data in hand, I leveraged the power of Power Query to transform it into a structured format suitable for the Power BI environment. 

The end result was a fully solved file in Power BI that accurately represented the financial data and helped to identify key insights and trends. For those interested in seeing my process, I have attached both the original unstructured data and the solved Power BI file for review. 

I'm proud of the work I accomplished and look forward to applying my skills and experience to future data analysis projects.
